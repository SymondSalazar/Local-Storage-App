# Local-Storage-App
This is my first project built with Node.js, using Express and React. It's also the first project I'm uploading to my GitHub! ðŸš€ It's a local storage app, and since I'm still a beginner, there's plenty of room for improvement. I'll keep refining it as I learn more! ðŸ”§âœ¨

#How to start
1.- First you should create a folder named SaveData inside the Api directory.

2.-Run npm install in the root folder then in the Api and client folder
